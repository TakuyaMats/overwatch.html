        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p><em>"Everyone Must Find Their Cause"</em></p>
        <p>One of the founding members of Overwatch, Ana uses her skills and expertise to defend her<br>
          home and the people she cares for.</p>
        <p>As the Omnic Crisis inflicted a heavy toll on Egypt, the country's depleted and undermanned<br>
          security forces relied on elite snipers for support. Among them was Ana Amari, who was<br>
          widely considered to be the world's best. Her superior marksmanship, decision-making, and<br>
          instincts made her a natural selection to join the Overwatch strike team that would end the war.</p>
        <p>Following the success of Overwatch's original mission, Ana served for many years as Strike<br>
          Commander Morrison's second-in-command. Despite her responsibilities in leading the<br>
          organization, Ana refused to step away from combat operations. She remained on active<br>
          duty well into her fifties, until she was believed to have been killed during a hostage rescue<br>
          mission by the Talon operative known as Widowmaker.</p>
        <p>In truth, Ana survived that encounter, despite being gravely wounded and losing her right<br>
          eye. During her recovery, she wrestled with the weight of a life spent in combat, and she<br>
          chose to stay out of the world's growing conflicts. However, as time passed, she realized she<br>
          could not sit on the sidelines while people threatened her city and the innocents around her.</p>
        <p>Now, Ana has rejoined the fight to protect her country from the forces that would destabilize<br>
          it, and most importantly, to keep her family and her closest allies safe.</p>
